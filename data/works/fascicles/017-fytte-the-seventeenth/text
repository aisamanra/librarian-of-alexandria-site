Eberhardt "Papercat" Von Kvotzburg frowned, and his eyebrows knotted
into perfect curls and settled underneath the rolling wrinkles that
had arrayed themselves on his expansive forehead. His hand gripped the cold
metal of the creaking, weather-beaten chair. His eyes darted—up, down, up,
down, left, down, up, up, down...

"Aye, I'm afraid 'tis true," she said as she sipped the paper cup
filled with overpriced coffee-like beverage. Her nose, shaped as it
was like a ski ramp, twitched in anticipation of the impending
caffeine.

"When did you start talking like a pirate?" he asked.

"There be a lot ye not know about me," she muttered. "Be that as it
may, ye know not of the treasure that awaits ye—the treasure that
awaits us all as we traverse the shores beyond—"

"—are you still talking about the grocery store?"

"Aye." She tested the temperature of the coffee with a tiny, noisy
sip, and then shrugged and threw back the entire cup without so much
as a flinch. "There be stranger things in the world than ye know,
Papercat. Much stranger things that may set their sights upon ye."

"You're aware that 'ye' is a nominative—not an objective—pronoun, no?"

"Shut ye the fuck up," she said with a slow, lilting cadence and a
haunting glare. "Let we get the fuck to the store of grocery."

And frankly, it would have been an okay grocery run if not for the
kraken.
