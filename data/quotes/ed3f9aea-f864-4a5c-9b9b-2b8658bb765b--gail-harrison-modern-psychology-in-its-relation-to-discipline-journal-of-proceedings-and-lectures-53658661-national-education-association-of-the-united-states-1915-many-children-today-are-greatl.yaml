content: Many children today are greatly to be pitied because too much is done for
  them and dictated to them and they are deprived of the learning processes. We seem
  to have dropped into an age of entertaining, a breathless going from one sensation
  to another, whether it be mechanical toys for the five-year-old or moving-picture
  plays for the sixteen-year-old. It not only destroys their power to think, but also
  makes happiness, contentment, and resourcefulness impossible. At seventeen, life
  is spoken of as "so dull" if there is not "something doing" every waking hour.
