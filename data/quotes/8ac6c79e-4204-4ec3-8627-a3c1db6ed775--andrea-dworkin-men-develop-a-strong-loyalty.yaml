content: Men develop a strong loyalty to violence. Men must come to terms with violence
  because it is the prime component of male identity. Institutionalized in sports,
  the military, acculturated sexuality, the history and mythology of heroism, it is
  taught to boys until they become its advocates-men, not women. Men become advocates
  of that which they most fear. In mastery of fear they experience freedom. Men transform
  their fear of male violence into a metaphysical commitment to male violence. Violence
  itself becomes the central definition of any experience that is profound and significant.
