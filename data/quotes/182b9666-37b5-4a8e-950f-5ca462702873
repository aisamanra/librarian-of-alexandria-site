content: "There are women who, however you may search them, prove to have no content\
  \ but are purely masks. The man who associates with such almost spectral, necessarily\
  \ unsatisfied beings is to be commiserated with, yet it is precisely they who are\
  \ able to arouse the desire of the man most strongly: he seeks for her soul \u2014\
  \ and goes on seeking."
