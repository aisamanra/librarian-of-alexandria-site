content: In the study of ideas, it is necessary to remember that insistence on hard-headed
  clarity issues from sentimental feeling, as it were a mist, cloaking the perplexities

  mode in which human intelligence functions. Our reasonings grasp at straws for premises
  and float on gossamers for deduction.
