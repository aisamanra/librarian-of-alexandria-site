content: "A true revelation, it seems to me, will only emerge from stubborn concentration\
  \ on a solitary problem. I am not in league with inventors or adventurers, nor with\
  \ travelers to exotic destinations. The surest\u2014also the quickest\u2014way to\
  \ awake the sense of wonder in ourselves is to look intently, undeterred, at a single\
  \ object. Sudenly, miraculously, it will reveal itself as something we have never\
  \ seen before."
