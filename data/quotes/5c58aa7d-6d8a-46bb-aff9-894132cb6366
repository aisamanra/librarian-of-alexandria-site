content: 'I was reading a book (about interjections, oddly enough) yesterday which
  included the phrase "In these days of political correctness..." talking about no
  longer making jokes that denigrated people for their culture or for the colour of
  their skin. And I thought, "That''s not actually anything to do with ''political
  correctness''. That''s just treating other people with respect."


  Which made me oddly happy. I started imagining a world in which we replaced the
  phrase "politically correct" wherever we could with "treating other people with
  respect", and it made me smile.


  You should try it. It''s peculiarly enlightening.


  I know what you''re thinking now. You''re thinking "Oh my god, that''s treating
  other people with respect gone mad!"
