author: Grant Morrison's Doom Patrol
content: '"Would you like something? Tea? Cakes? We have everything except hope. There
  is no hope. We are shadows stumbling through the endless freezing dark of existence.
  Empire biscuits? All is futile. We try to impose meaning on the chaos of being,
  but there is no meaning. Fairy cakes? We cultivate a pointless optimism as our bodies
  decay and disintegrate towards the grave. We hope for the future, but in the end
  we come to dust. In the end, even the stars are extinguished and entropy reduces
  everything to a valueless nullity. We cannot win. We cannot break even. We cannot
  even stay out of the game. There is no hope. There is no escape. We are alone with
  this endless horror."


  "That''s okay. I like it here."'
