content: We're deathly afraid of that stabbing word 'pretentious,' the word that students
  use to curse each other's ambition. It's a young person's word, a shortcut-to-thinking
  word. I'm a big fan of pretension. It means 'an aspiration or intention that may
  or may not reach fulfillment.' It doesn't mean failing upward. It means trying to
  exceed your grasp. Which is how things grow.
