content: "We live in a world ruled by fictions of every kind \u2014 mass merchandising,\
  \ advertising, politics conducted as a branch of advertising, the instant translation\
  \ of science and technology into popular imagery, the increasing blurring and intermingling\
  \ of identities within the realm of consumer goods, the preempting of any free or\
  \ original imaginative response to experience by the television screen. We live\
  \ inside an enormous novel. For the writer in particular it is less and less necessary\
  \ for him to invent the fictional content of his novel. The fiction is already there.\
  \ The writer\u2019s task is to invent the reality."
