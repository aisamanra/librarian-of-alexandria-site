  \ before. In fact, the design tools that we write to do the projects that we're\
  \ doing are a sort of product in and of themselves.\r\n\r\nI think in reality, today,\
  \ if you use the same tools as everyone else, you kind of build the same products.\
  \ If you write your own tools, you can sort of see new things, design new things."
