content: 'I don''t believe in total freedom for the artist. Left on his own, free
  to do anything he likes, the artist ends up doing nothing at all. If there''s one
  thing that''s dangerous for an artist, it''s precisely this question of total freedom,
  waiting for inspiration and the rest of it. '
