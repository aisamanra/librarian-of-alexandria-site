content: Your head's like mine, like all our heads; big enough to contain every god
  and devil there ever was. Big enough to hold the weight of oceans and the turning
  stars. Whole universes fit in there! But what do we choose to keep in this miraculous
  cabinet? Little broken things, sad trinkets that we play with over and over. The
  world turns our key and we play the same little tune again and again and we think
  that tune's all we are.
