content: "Most writers on logic strongly object to all symbols, except the venerable\
  \ Barbara, Celarent, etc., \u2026I should advise the reader not to make up his mind\
  \ on this point until he has well weighed two facts which nobody disputes, both\
  \ separately and in connexion. First, logic is the only science which has made no\
  \ progress since the revival of letters; secondly, logic is the only science which\
  \ has produced no growth of symbols."
