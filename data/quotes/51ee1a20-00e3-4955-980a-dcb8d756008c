author: John Rogers
content: 'There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old''s life:
  The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders
  a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted,
  socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course,
  involves orcs.'
