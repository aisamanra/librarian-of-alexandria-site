content: "Machines which ape people are tending to encroach on every aspect of people's\
  \ lives, and that such machines force people to behave like machines. The new electronic\
  \ devices do indeed have the power to force people to \"communicate\" with them\
  \ and with each other on the terms of the machine. Whatever structurally does not\
  \ fit the logic of machines is effectively filtered from a culture dominated by\
  \ their use.\r\n\r\nThe machine-like behaviour of people chained to electronics\
  \ constitutes a degradation of their well-being and of their dignity which, for\
  \ most people in the long run, becomes intolerable. Observations of the sickening\
  \ effect of programmed environments show that people in them become indolent, impotent,\
  \ narcissistic and apolitical. The political process breaks down, because people\
  \ cease to be able to govern themselves; they demand to be managed.\r\n"
