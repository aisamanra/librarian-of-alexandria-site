author: Umberto Eco, Foucault's Pendulum
content: "Incredulity doesn't kill curiosity; it encourages it. Though distrustful\
  \ of logical chains of ideas, I loved the polyphony of ideas. As long as you don't\
  \ believe in them, the collision of two ideas \u2014 both false \u2014 can create\
  \ a pleasing interval, a kind of diabolus in musica. I had no respect for some ideas\
  \ people were willing to stake their lives on, but two or three ideas that I did\
  \ not respect might still make a nice melody. Or have a good beat, and if it was\
  \ jazz, all the better."
