author: E.E. Cummings
content: "my advice to all young people who wish to become poets is: do something\
  \ easy, like learning how to blow up the world\u2014unless you're not only willing,\
  \ but glad, to feel and work and fight till you die.  \nDoes this sound dismal?\
  \ It isn't.  \nIt's the most wonderful life on earth.  \nOr so I feel."
