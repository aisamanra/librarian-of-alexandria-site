  \ Quite literally, we cannot afford unloved children\u2014but we pay heavily for\
  \ them every day. There should not be the slightest communal concern when a woman\
  \ elects to destroy the life of her thousandth-of-an-ounce embryo. But all society\
  \ should rise up in alarm when it hears that a baby that is not wanted is about\
  \ to be born."
