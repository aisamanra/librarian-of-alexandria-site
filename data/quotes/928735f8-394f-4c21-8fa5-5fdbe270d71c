content: What if, however, humans exceed animals in their capacity for violence precisely
  because they speak? As Hegel was already well aware, there is something violent
  in the very symbolisation of a thing, which equals its mortification. This violence
  operates at multiple levels. Language simplifies the designated thing, reducing
  it to a single feature. It dismembers the thing, destroying its organic unity, treating
  its parts and properties as autonomous. It inserts the thing into a field of meaning
  which is ultimately external to it. When we name gold "gold," we violently extract
  a metal from its natural texture, investing into it our dreams of wealth, power,
  spiritual purity, and so on, which have nothing whatsoever to do with the immediate
  reality of gold.
