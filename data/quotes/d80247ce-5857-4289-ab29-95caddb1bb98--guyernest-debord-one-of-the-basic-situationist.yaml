content: "One of the basic situationist practices is the d\xE9rive [literally: \"\
  drifting\"], a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances. D\xE9rives involve\
  \ playful-constructive behavior and awareness of psychogeographical effects, and\
  \ are thus quite different from the classic notions of journey or stroll.\r\n\r\n\
  In a d\xE9rive one or more persons during a certain period drop their relations,\
  \ their work and leisure activities, and all their other usual motives for movement\
  \ and action, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and\
  \ the encounters they find there. Chance is a less important factor in this activity\
  \ than one might think: from a d\xE9rive point of view cities have psychogeographical\
  \ contours, with constant currents, fixed points and vortexes that strongly discourage\
  \ entry into or exit from certain zones."
