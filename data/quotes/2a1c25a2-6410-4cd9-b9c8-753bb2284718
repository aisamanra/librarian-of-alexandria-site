  and buy a hundred envelopes and put them in the closet? And so I pretend not to
  hear her. And go out to get an envelope because I''m going to have a hell of a good
  time in the process of buying one envelope. I meet a lot of people. And, see some
  great looking babes. And a fire engine goes by. And I give them the thumbs up. And,
  and ask a woman what kind of dog that is. And, and I don''t know. The moral of the
  story is, is we''re here on Earth to fart around. And, of course, the computers
  will do us out of that. And, what the computer people don''t realize, or they don''t
  care, is we''re dancing animals. You know, we love to move around. And, we''re not
  supposed to dance at all anymore. '
