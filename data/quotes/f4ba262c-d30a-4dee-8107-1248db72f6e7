  \ and blind alley swarms with them, \u2014 that the poorest people commonly have\
  \ them in most abundance, \u2014 that there are few marriages that are not blest\
  \ with at least one of these bargains, \u2014 how often they turn out ill, and defeat\
  \ the fond hopes of their parents, taking to vicious courses, which end in poverty,\
  \ disgrace, the gallows, etc. \u2014 I cannot for my life tell what cause for pride\
  \ there can possibly be in having them. If they were young phoenixes, indeed, that\
  \ were born but one in a year, there might be a pretext. But when they are so common\
  \ \u2014"
