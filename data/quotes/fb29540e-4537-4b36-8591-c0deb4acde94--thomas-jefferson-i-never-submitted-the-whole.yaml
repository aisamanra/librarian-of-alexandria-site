content: I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party
  of men whatever, in religion, in philosophy, in politics or in anything else, where
  I was capable of thinking for myself. Such an addiction is the last degradation
  of a free and moral agent. If I could not go to Heaven but with a party, I would
  not go there at all.
