content: We are buried beneath the weight of information, which is being confused
  with knowledge; quantity is being confused with abundance and wealth with happiness.
  Leona Helmsley's dog made 12 million last year... and Dean McLaine, a farmer in
  Ohio made $30,000. It's just a gigantic version of the madness that grows in every
  one of our brains. We are monkeys with money and guns.
