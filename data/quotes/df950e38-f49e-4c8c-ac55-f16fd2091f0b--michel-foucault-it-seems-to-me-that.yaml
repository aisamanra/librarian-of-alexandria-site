author: Michel Foucault
content: It seems to me that the real political task in our contemporary society is
  to criticize the workings of institutions, particularly the ones that appear to
  be neutral and independent, and to attack them in such a way that the political
  violence, which has always exercised itself obscurely through them, will finally
  be unmasked so that one can fight against them.
