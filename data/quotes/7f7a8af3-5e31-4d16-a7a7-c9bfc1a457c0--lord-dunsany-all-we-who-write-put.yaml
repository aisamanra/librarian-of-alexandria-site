content: All we who write put me in mind of sailors hastily making rafts upon doomed
  ships. When we break up under the heavy years and go down into eternity with all
  that is ours our thoughts like small lost rafts float on awhile upon Oblivion's
  sea. They will not carry much over those tides, our names and a phrase or two and
  little else.
