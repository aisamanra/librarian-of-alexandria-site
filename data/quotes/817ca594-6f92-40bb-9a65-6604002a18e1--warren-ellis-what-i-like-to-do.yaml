content: What I like to do is take that video of David Lynch talking about the horror
  of watching films "on your fucking telephone" and watch it on my fucking telephone,
  and then I think about things like why, in Britain, we call the television the telly
  but we call the telephone the phone, and that maybe we should have called the television
  the vision, except of course that they were once called televisors, so we could
  have called it the visor, which is actually kind of nice, and in Spain they're still
  called televisors so why the fuck not, and also it occurs to me that once upon a
  time people could listen to concerts over the telephone, and now we can make phone
  calls through our televisions, and given that "film," "television" and "phone" are
  now words that denote spaces around things rather than the things they originally
  defined, I think I'll watch a film on anything I like and all devices are now called
  "scopes" until further notice.
