  \ concentration camps of the spirit  \nThese gigantic freezers vomiting the imperialism\
  \  \nThese slaughters of plundering and plunder  \nThis arrogance of bronze and\
  \ thirst  \nThis eunuchoid science  \nNot the dribble of transistorised and riveted\
  \ hulks  \nThe divine one  \nThe delirious one  \nThe superb one  \nCHAOS  \nUNIVERSAL\
  \  \nI want magical entities, vibrating vehicles  \nTo prolong to be to it abyss\
  \  \nLike fish of a timeless ocean. I want  \nJewels, mechanics as perfect as the\
  \ heart  \nWomb-ships anterooms  \nRebirth into other dimensions  \nI want whore-ships\
  \ driven  \nBy the sperm of passionate ejaculations  \nIn an engine of flesh  \n\
  I want rockets complex and secret,  \nHumming-bird ornithopters,  \nSipping the\
  \ thousand-year-old nectar of dwarf stars...\n"
