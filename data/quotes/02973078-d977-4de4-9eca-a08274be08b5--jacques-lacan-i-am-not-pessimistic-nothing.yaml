content: I am not pessimistic. Nothing is going to happen. For the simple reason that
  man is a good-for-nothing, not even capable of destroying himself. Personally, I
  would find the idea of an all-encompassing plague, produced by man, rather marvellous.
  It would be the proof that he had managed to do something with his own hands and
  head, without divine or natural intervention.
