author: Ursula K. Le Guin
content: What the hell is nostalgia doing in a science-fiction film? With the whole
  universe and all the future to play in, Lucas took his marvelous toys and crawled
  under the fringed cloth on the parlor table, back into a nice safe hideyhole, along
  with Flash Gordon and the Cowardly Lion and Huck Skywalker and the Flying Aces and
  the Hitler Jugend. If there's a message there, I don't think I want to hear it.
