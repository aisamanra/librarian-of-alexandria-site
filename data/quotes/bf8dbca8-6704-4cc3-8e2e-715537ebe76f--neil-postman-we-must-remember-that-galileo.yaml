content: We must remember that Galileo merely said that the language of _nature_ is
  written in mathematics. He did not say _everything_ is. And even the truth about
  nature need not be expressed in mathematics. For most of human history, the language
  of nature has been the language of myth and ritual. These forms, one might add,
  had the virtues of leaving nature unthreatened and of encouraging the belief that
  human beings are part of it. It hardly befits a people who stand ready to blow up
  the planet to praise themselves too vigorously for having found the true way to
  talk about nature.
