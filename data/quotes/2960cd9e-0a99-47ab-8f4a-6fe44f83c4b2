content: "For these beings, fall is the ever normal season, the only weather, there\
  \ be no choice beyond. Where do they come from? The dust. Where do they go? The\
  \ grave. Does blood stir their veins? No: the night wind. What ticks in their head?\
  \ The worm. What speaks from their mouth? The toad. What sees from their eye? The\
  \ snake. What hears with their ear? The abyss between the stars. They sift the human\
  \ storm for souls, eat flesh of reason, fill tombs with sinners. They frenzy forth.\
  \ In gusts they beetle-scurry, creep, thread, filter, motion, make all moons sullen,\
  \ and surely cloud all clear-run waters. The spider-web hears them, trembles\u2014\
  breaks. Such are the autumn people. Beware of them."
