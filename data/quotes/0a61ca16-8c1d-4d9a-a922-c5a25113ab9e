author: Umberto Eco, Foucault's Pendulum
content: People believe those who sell lotions that make lost hair grow back. They
  sense instinctively that the salesman is putting together truths that don't go together,
  that he's not being logical, that he's not speaking in good faith. But they've been
  told that God is mysterious, unfathomable, so to them incoherence is the closest
  thing to God. The farfetched is the closest thing to a miracle.
