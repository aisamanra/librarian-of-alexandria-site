content: "My grandfather had died, and my mother was trying to explain it to me...\
  \ Grandpa isn't coming back? No, she said. Not ever again... And I remember saying,\
  \ hold everything right fucking there. You went to all the trouble of conceiving\
  \ me, and giving birth to me, and raising me and clothing me and all... and you\
  \ make me cry and things hurt so much and disappointments crush my heart every day\
  \ and I can't do half the things I want to and sometimes I just want to scream \u2014\
  \ and what I've got to look forward to is my body breaking and something flipping\
  \ off the switch in my head \u2014 I go through all this, and then there's death?\
  \ What is the motherfucking deal here? I wasn't having this. This was not fair."
