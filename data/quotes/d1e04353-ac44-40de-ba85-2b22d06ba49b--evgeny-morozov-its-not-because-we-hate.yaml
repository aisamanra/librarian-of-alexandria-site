content: It's not because we hate the algorithms, or we hate databases, or we hate
  technological infrastructure or networks, that we are suspicious of Silicon Valley
  and the intrusions that they bring into how we think about the public or politics.
  It's because the logic that these algorithms and sensors embed is a very troubling
  political and economic logic. It leads to certain assumptions about public and private
  institutions, and consumers, citizens, and administators, that on second thought
  most of us would probably reject. Because it does shrink the public space. It does
  result in public institutions being hijacked by the logic of the market. It does
  shrink the kind of risks that we can take. And I think eventually it does disable
  a lot of cultural and political innovation. And that's the real reason to hate them.
