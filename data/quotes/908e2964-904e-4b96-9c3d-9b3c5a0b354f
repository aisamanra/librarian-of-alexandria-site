author: Turkish proverb
content: Coffee should be hot as hell, black as death, and gulped greatly from a cadaver-hued
  earthenware mug while listening to nightmarish glitch techno through big fuck-off
  headphones and staring out the window at fall-colored ash leaves shuddering in low-horizon
  sunlight as window drafts under your ugly desk refrigerate your feet.
