  Warren Ellis''s "Transmetropolitan"'
content: Did you ever want to set someone's head on fire, just to see what it looked
  like? Did you ever stand in the street and think to yourself, I could make that
  nun go blind just by giving her a kiss? Did you ever lay out plans for stitching
  babies and stray cats into a Perfect New Human? Did you ever stand naked surrounded
  by people who want your gleaming sperm, squirting frankincense, soma and testosterone
  from every pore? If so, then you're the bastard who stole my drugs Friday night.
  And I'll find you. Oh, yes.
