  \ It is a viral pandemic that masks infection by pretending to be part of you. There's\
  \ no cure. But if you know the structure of the virus, at least you can recognize\
  \ the infection as not-you. \r\n\r\n\"No way, I'm not getting infected, I'm not\
  \ exposing myself to all that trash. I'm going to think for myself.\"\r\n \r\nThat's\
  \ the virus talking."
