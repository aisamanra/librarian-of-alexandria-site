  High Weirdness By Mail'
content: If you sincerely desire a truly well-rounded education, you must study the
  extremists, the obscure and "nutty". You need the balance! Your poor brain is already
  being impregnated with middle-of-the-road crap, twenty-four hours a day, no matter
  what. Network TV, newspapers, radio, magazines at the supermarket... even if you
  never watch, read, listen, or leave your house, even if you are deaf and blind,
  the telepathic pressure alone of the uncountable normals surrounding you will insure
  that you are automatically well-grounded in consensus reality.
