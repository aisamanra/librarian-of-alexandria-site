content: "The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention\
  \ to cut the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike\
  \ or touch the enemy\u2019s cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement.\
  \ It is essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking\
  \ or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him."
