content: 'Things are set up as contraries that are not even in the same category.
  Listen to me: the opposite of radical is superficial; the opposite of liberal is
  stingy; the opposite of conservative is destructive. Thus I will describe myself
  as a radical conservative liberal; but certain of the tainted red fish will swear
  that there can be no such fish as that. Beware of those who use words to mean their
  opposites. At the same time have pity on them, for usually this trick is their only
  stock in trade.'
