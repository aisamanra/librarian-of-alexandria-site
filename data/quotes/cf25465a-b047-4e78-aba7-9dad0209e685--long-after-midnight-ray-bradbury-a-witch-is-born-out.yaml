author: Long After Midnight, Ray Bradbury
content: A Witch is born out of the true hungers of her time. I am a child of the
  poisonous wind that copulated with the river on an oil-slick, garbage infested midnight.
  I turn about on my own parentage. I inoculate against those very biles that brought
  me to light. I am a serum born of venoms. I am the antibody of all time.
