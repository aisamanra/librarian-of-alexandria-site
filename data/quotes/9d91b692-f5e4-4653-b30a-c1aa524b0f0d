  \ perturbation/inversion/disturbance _within nirvana itself_\u2014that is to say,\
  \ prior to the split between nirvana and false appearance\u2014so that the Absolute\
  \ itself (the cosmic Force, or whatever it is called) gets radically perverted.\
  \ The traces of this inversion are discernible even in pop-cultural New Age icons\
  \ like Darth Vader from _Star Wars_: in the idea that the truly evil people are\
  \ those who have gained access to the Force that enables us to reach the true realm\
  \ beyond false material reality, but then perverted/misused this Force, employing\
  \ it for bad, evil ends. What, however, if this fall into perversion is original,\
  \ the original monstrous cut/excess, and the opposition between nirvana and desire\
  \ for false appearances is there to conceal this monstrosity?"
