author: G.K. Chesterton
content: Many clever men like you have trusted to civilization. Many clever Babylonians,
  many clever Egytians, many clever men at the end of Rome. Can you tell me, in a
  world that is flagrant with the failures of civilizations, what there is particularly
  immortal about yours?
