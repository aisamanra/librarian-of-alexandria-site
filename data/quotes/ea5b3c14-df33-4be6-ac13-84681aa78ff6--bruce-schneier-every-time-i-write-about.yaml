content: 'Every time I write about the impossibility of effectively protecting digital
  files on a general purpose computer, I get responses from people decrying the death
  of copyright. How will authors and artists get paid for their work? they ask me.
  Truth be told, I don''t know. I feel rather like the physicist who just explained
  relativity to a group of would-be interstellar travelers, only to be asked: How
  do you expect us to get to the stars, then? I''m sorry, but I don''t know that,
  either.'
