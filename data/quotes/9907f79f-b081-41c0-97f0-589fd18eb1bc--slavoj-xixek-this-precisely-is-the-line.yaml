content: "This, precisely, is the line of reasoning we should reject; let us take\
  \ the extreme case, a mortal and violent struggle against a Fascist enemy. Should\
  \ we show respect for the abyss of the radical Otherness of Hitler's personality\
  \ beneath all his evil acts? It is here that we should apply Christ's famous words\
  \ about how he has come to bring the sword and division, not unity and peace: out\
  \ of our very love for humanity, including (whatever remains of) the humanity of\
  \ the Nazis themselves, we should fight them in an absolutely ruthless and disrespectful\
  \ way. In short, the Jewish saying often quoted apropos of the Holocaust ('When\
  \ somebody saves one man from death, he saves the whole of humanity') should be\
  \ supplemented with: 'When somebody kills just one true enemy of humanity, he (not\
  \ not kills, but saves) the whole of humanity.' The true ethical test is not only\
  \ the readiness to save victims, but also\u2014even more, perhaps\u2014the ruthless\
  \ dedication to annihilating those who made them victims."
