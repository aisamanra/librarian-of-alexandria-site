  Just imagine. Aren't these some kind of, how do you call it, vagina dentata, dental
  vaginas threatening to swallow you? I think that flowers are something inherently
  disgusting. I mean, are people aware what a horrible thing these flowers are? I
  mean, basically it's an open invitation to all insects and bees, "Come and screw
  me," you know? I think that flowers should be forbidden to children.
