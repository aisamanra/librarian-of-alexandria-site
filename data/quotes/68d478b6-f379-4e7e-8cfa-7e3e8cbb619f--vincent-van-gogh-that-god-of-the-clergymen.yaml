content: "That God of the clergymen, He is for me as dead as a doornail. But am I\
  \ an atheist for all that? The clergymen consider me as such\u2014be it so; but\
  \ I love, and how could I feel love if I did not live, and if others did not live,\
  \ and then, if we live, there is something mysterious in that. Now call that God,\
  \ or human nature or whatever you like, but there is something which I cannot define\
  \ systematically, though it is very much alive and very real, and see, that is God,\
  \ or as good as God. To believe in God for me is to feel that there is a God, not\
  \ a dead one, or a stuffed one, but a living one, who with irresistible force urges\
  \ us toward aimer encore; that is my opinion."
