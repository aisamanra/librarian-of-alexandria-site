author: C.S. Lewis
content: '...there is no escape from [the gods] into sleep or madness, for they can
  pursue you into them with dreams. Indeed, you are then most at their mercy. The
  nearest thing we have to a defence against them (but there is no real defence) is
  to be very wide awake and sober and hard at work, to hear no music, never to look
  at earth or sky, and (above all) to love no one.'
