content: One of the great insights of psychoanalysis is that you never really want
  an object, you only want the wanting, which means the solution is to set your sights
  on an impossible ideal and work hard to reach it. You won't. That's not just okay,
  that's the point. It's ok if you fantasize about knowing kung fu if you then try
  to actually learn kung fu, eventually you will understand you can never really know
  kung fu, and then you will die. And it will have been worth it.
