content: "Stop thinking about art works as objects, and start thinking about them\
  \ as triggers for experiences. (Roy Ascott's phrase.) That solves a lot of problems:\
  \ we don't have to argue whether photographs are art, or whether performances are\
  \ art, or whether Carl Andre's bricks or Andrew Serranos's piss or Little Richard's\
  \ 'Long Tall Sally' are art, because we say, 'Art is something that happens, a process,\
  \ not a quality, and all sorts of things can make it happen.' ... [W]hat makes a\
  \ work of art 'good' for you is not something that is already 'inside' it, but something\
  \ that happens inside you \u2014 so the value of the work lies in the degree to\
  \ which it can help you have the kind of experience that you call art."
