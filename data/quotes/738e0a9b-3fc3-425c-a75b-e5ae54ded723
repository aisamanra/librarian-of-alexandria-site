author: Ursula K. Le Guin
content: Fantasy is true, of course. It isn't factual, but it is true. Children know
  that. Adults know it too, and that is precisely why many of them are afraid of fantasy.
  They know that its truth challenges, even threatens, all that is false, all that
  is phony, unnecessary, and trivial... They are afraid of dragons, because they are
  afraid of freedom.
