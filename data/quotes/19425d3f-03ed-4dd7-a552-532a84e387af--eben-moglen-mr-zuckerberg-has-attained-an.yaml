  \ Friday Night\u2014that is, \"everybody needs to get laid\"\u2014and he turned\
  \ it into a structure for degenerating the integrity of human personality. And he\
  \ has, to a remarkable extent, succeeded with a very poor deal\u2014namely, \"I\
  \ will give you free web hosting, and some PHP doodads, and you get spying, for\
  \ free, all the time.\" And it works. That's the sad part, it works."
