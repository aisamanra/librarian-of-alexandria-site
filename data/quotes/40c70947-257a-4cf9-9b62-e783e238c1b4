author: Niccolo Machiavelli
content: '...men may second their fortune, but cannot oppose it; that they may weave
  its warp, but cannot break it. Yet they should never give up, because there is always
  hope, though they know not the end and move towards it along roads which cross one
  another and as yet are unexplored; and since there is hope, they should not despair,
  no matter what fortune brings or in what travail they find themselves.'
