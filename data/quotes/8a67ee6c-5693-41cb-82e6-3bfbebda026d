  \ highly commercial medium of highly disputed (and disputable) artistic merit which\
  \ is largely dominated by male power fantasies and characterized by shoddy acting,\
  \ laughable dialogue, and two-dimensional plots that many people simply skip past\
  \ to get to the action and which is perpetually at the center of a media shitstorm\
  \ for its graphic and often outright puerile content, and in which women always\
  \ have unfeasibly massive hooters quivering beneath bizarre and scanty costumes,\
  \ but which is rabidly defended by a massive fanbase who range from the fairly reasonable\
  \ to the clearly deranged who loyally purchase tickets to conventions at which they\
  \ awkwardly photograph themselves crooking their arms around real human women wearing\
  \ aforementioned bizarre and scanty costumes with a minimum of self-awareness or\
  \ -reflection\r\n\r\nwhereas the other is my horse, who i have named \"pornography\"\
  \ for reasons i shall reveal to neither man nor god. PORNOGRAPHY AWAY"
