content: I have been a working film director (REPO MAN, WALKER, etc) for twenty-odd
  years, and copyright law has never worked in my favour - only in the favour of massive
  corporations such as Universal / Vivendi, which seize even the "so-called inalienable
  rights of authors." Patent and copyright laws are a fraud perpetrated by corporations
  and governments against the actual producers of creative work. The independent filmmaker's
  rule of thumb is always, if Jack Valenti's in favour of it, I'm against it.
