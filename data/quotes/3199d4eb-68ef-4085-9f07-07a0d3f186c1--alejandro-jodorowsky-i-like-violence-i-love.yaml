content: I like violence. I love violence! I hate the weak person who go to art and
  say "Oh, that hurt me... that image!" Why to make picture for that person? They
  are blind! Poetry is violent. This is the reality. There is so much in a violent
  world... they don't want to see that. I am in the middle of violence. I am in the
  middle of the screen of television now. There I am.
