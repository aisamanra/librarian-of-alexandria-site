author: Andrey Aresnjevich Tarkovskij's Stalker
content: Let everything that's been planned come true. Let them believe. And let them
  have a laugh at their passions. Because what they call passion actually is not some
  emotional energy, but just the friction between their souls and the outside world.
  And most important, let them believe in themselves. Let them be helpless like children,
  because weakness is a great thing, and strength is nothing. When a man is just born,
  he is weak and flexible. when he dies, he is hard and insensitive. When a tree is
  growing, it's tender and pliant. But when it's dry and hard, it dies. hardness and
  strength are death's companion. Pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness
  of being. Because what has hardened will never win.
