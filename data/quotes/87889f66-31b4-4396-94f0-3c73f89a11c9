content: "Maybe it is a good thing for us to keep a few dreams of a house that we\
  \ shall live in later, always later, so much later, in fact, that we shall not have\
  \ time to achieve it. For a house that was final, one that stood in symmetrical\
  \ relation to the house we were born in, would lead to thoughts\u2014serious, sad\
  \ thoughts\u2014and not to dreams. It is better to live in a state of impermanence\
  \ than in one of finality."
