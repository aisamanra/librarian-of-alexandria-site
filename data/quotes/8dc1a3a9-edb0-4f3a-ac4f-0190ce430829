content: Everyone's looking for someone to blame. Society. Culture. Hollywood. Predators.
  Looking everywhere but the right place. Children are very simple, Mr. Jerusalem.
  Very easy devices to break, or assemble wrong. You want to know who did this to
  these kids? Only their parents. That's the thing no one wants to hear. Every time
  you stop thinking about how you're treating your kid, you make one of these. It
  really is as simple as that. It's got nothing to do with the failure of the society
  or any of that. It's got everything to do with the responsibility of making a human.
