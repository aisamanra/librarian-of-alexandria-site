content: I love religion. I could make up religions all day. I sort of think that
  in an ideal world I'd like to be a religion designer. I'd like people come up to
  me and say, "I need a religion." I'd go talk to them for awhile, and I'd design
  a religion for them. That would be a great job. There's a need for people like that.
  Fortunately, seeing that one can't actually do it, I get paid for sort of making
  them up anyway.
