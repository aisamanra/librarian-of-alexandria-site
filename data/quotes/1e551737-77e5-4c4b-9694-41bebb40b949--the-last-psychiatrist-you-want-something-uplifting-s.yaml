content: 'You want something uplifting, so here you go: you can never have a good
  relationship with anyone when your focus is the relationship. There''s a human being
  there who existed well before you got to them, and they weren''t built for you or
  your needs or your parents or your future dreams as an actor. If you want to be
  happy with someone then your body and mind have to instinctively adapt to their
  happiness. If you''re not ready for this kind of sacrifice, then you''re simply
  not ready.'
