content: The uneducated public will have lower standards than what a serious photographer
  will have. That's normal; they don't know any better. A true artist is judging his/her
  images on a professional level (and if not, someone else certainly will). This is
  a public who will pay thousands in finance charges annually on various credit card
  bills and balk at putting a $50 piece of art in a $25 frame. An $80 opera ticket
  is not justifiable, although a $150 seat for an NFL football game is.
