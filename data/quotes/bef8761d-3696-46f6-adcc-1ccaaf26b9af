content: "He'd noticed that sex bore some resemblance to cookery: It fascinated people,\
  \ they sometimes bought books full of complicated recipes and interesting pictures,\
  \ and sometimes when they were really hungry they created vast banquets in their\
  \ imagination\u2014but at the end of the day they'd settle quite happily for egg\
  \ and chips, if it was well done and maybe had a slice of tomato."
