author: George Orwell
content: The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one
  *is* sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not
  push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly intercourse impossible, and
  that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the
  inevitable price of fastening one's love upon other human individuals.
