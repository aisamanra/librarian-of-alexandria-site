content: Rap has a bad reputation in white circles, where many people believe it consists
  of obscene and violent anti-white and anti-female guttural. Some of it does. Most
  does not. Most white listeners don't care; they hear black voices in a litany of
  discontent, and tune out. Yet rap plays the same role today as Bob Dylan did in
  1960, giving voice to the hopes and angers of a generation, and a lot of rap is
  powerful writing.
