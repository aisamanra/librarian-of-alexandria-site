content: As my wife once remarked to Vice President Al Gore, the "haves and havenots"
  of the future will not be caused so much by being connected or not to the Internet,
  since most important content is already available in public libraries, free and
  open to all. the real haves and have-nots are those who have or have not acquired
  the discernment to search for and make use of high content wherever it may be found.
