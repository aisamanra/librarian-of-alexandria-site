content: The kinds of landscape I try to find in my films... exist only in our dreams.
  For me a true landscape is not just a representation of a desert or a forest. It
  shows an inner state of mind, literally inner landscapes, and it is the human soul
  that is visible through the landscapes presented in my films.
