author: The poet Treherne in G.K. Chesterton's The Trees of Pride
content: Show... when you next sit in judgement, a little mercy to some wretched man
  who drinks and robs because he must drink beer to taste it, and take it to drink
  it. Have compassion on the next batch of poor thieves, who have to hold things in
  order to have them. But if you ever find me [the poet] stealing one small farthing,
  when I can shut my eyes and see the city of El Dorado, then ... show me no mercy,
  for I shall deserve none.
