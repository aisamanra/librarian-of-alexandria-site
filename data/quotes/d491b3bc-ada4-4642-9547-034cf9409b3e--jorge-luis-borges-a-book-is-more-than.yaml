author: Jorge Luis Borges
content: 'A book is more than a verbal structure or series of verbal structures; it
  is the dialogue it establishes with its reader and the intonation it imposes upon
  his voice and the changing and durable images it leaves in his memory. A book is
  not an isolated being: it is a relationship, an axis of innumerable relationships.'
