content: "The famous mathematical sociologist Paul Lazarfeld once said, \"You never\
  \ understand a phenomenon unless you can make it go away.\" We might add, \"or unless\
  \ you can reverse its direction.\"\r\n\r\nPsychologist William McGuire (1983, 1989)\
  \ suggested as one of many ways to develop new hypotheses that you can take some\
  \ seemingly obvious relationship and imagine conditions where its opposite would\
  \ hold."
