  \ or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings,\
  \ photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street\
  \ signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to\
  \ steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft)\
  \ will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is non-existent. And\
  \ don\u2019t bother concealing your thievery\u2014celebrate it if you feel like\
  \ it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: \"It\u2019s not where\
  \ you take things from\u2014it\u2019s where you take them to.\""
