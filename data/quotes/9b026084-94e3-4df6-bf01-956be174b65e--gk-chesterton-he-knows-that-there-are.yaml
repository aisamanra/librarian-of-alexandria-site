author: G.K. Chesterton
content: "He knows that there are in the soul tints more bewildering, more numberless\
  \ and\r\nmore nameless, than the colours of an autumn forest... Yet he seriously\
  \ believes\r\nthat these things can every one of them, in all their tones and semi-tones,\
  \ in\r\nall their blends and unions, be accurately represented by an arbitrary system\
  \ of\r\ngrunts and squeals. He believes that an ordinary civilised stockbroker can\
  \ really\r\nproduce out of his own inside, noises which denote all the mysteries\
  \ of memory\r\nand all the agonies of desire."
