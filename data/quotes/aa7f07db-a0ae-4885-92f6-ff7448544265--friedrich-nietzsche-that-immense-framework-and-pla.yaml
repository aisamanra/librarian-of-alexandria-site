author: Friedrich Nietzsche
content: That immense framework and planking of concepts to which the needy man clings
  his whole life long in order to preserve himself is nothing but a scaffolding and
  toy for the most audacious feats of the liberated intellect. And when it smashes
  this framework to pieces, throws it into confusion, and puts it back together in
  an ironic fashion, pairing the most alien things and separating the closest, it
  is demonstrating that he has no need of these makeshits of indigence and that it
  will not be guided by intuitions rather than by concepts. There is no regular path
  which leads from these intutions into the land of ghostly schemata, the land of
  abstractions. There exists no word for these intuitions; when man sees them he grows
  dumb, or else he speaks only in forbidden metaphors and in unheard-of combinations
  of concepts. He does this so that by shattering and mocking the old conceptual barriers
  he may at least correspond creatively to the impression of the powerful present
  intuition.
