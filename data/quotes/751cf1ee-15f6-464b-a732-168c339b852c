content: I am very interested in words, and what we have words for and what we haven't
  got words for. For instance, the word "paranoia." It always seems very strange to
  me that we have this word which means, in effect, that someone feels that he is
  being persecuted when the people who are persecuting him don't think that he is.
  But we haven't got a word for the condition in which you are persecuting someone
  without realizing it, which I would have thought is as serious a condition as the
  other, and certainly no less common.
