content: "Maybe this is all pure gibberish\u2014a product of the demented imagination\
  \ of a lazy drunken hillbilly with a heart full of hate who has found out a way\
  \ to live out there where the real winds blow - to sleep late, have fun, get wild,\
  \ drink whiskey and ride fast on empty streets with nothing in mind except falling\
  \ in love and not getting arrested...\nRes ipsa loquitur. Let the good times roll."
