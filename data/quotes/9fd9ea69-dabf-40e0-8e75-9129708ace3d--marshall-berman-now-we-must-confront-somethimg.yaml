content: 'Now we must confront somethimg even more perplexing: next to the Communist
  Manifesto, the whole body of capitalist apologetics, from Adam Ferguson to Milton
  Friedman is remarkably pale and empty of life. The celebrants of capitalism tell
  us surprisingly little of its infinite horizons, its revolutionary audacity, its
  dynamic creativity, its adventurousness and romance, its capacity to make men not
  only more comfortable but more alive.'
