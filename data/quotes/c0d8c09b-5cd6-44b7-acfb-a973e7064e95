author: The Storyteller
content: I am a teller of stories, a weaver of dreams. I can dance, sing, and in the
  right weather I can stand on my head. I know seven words of Latin, I have a little
  magic, and a trick or two. I know the proper way to meet a Dragon, I can fight dirty
  but not fair, I once swallowed thirty oysters in a minute. I am not domestic, I
  am a luxury, and in that sense, necessary.
