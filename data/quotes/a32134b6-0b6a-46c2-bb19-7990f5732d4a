author: The Gospel of Thomas
content: 'Then the Lord himself spoke and said: "If you can grasp what is meant by
  this, you will be delivered from the fear of Endings. So do not cease from searching.
  Yet, remember this; when you find that for which you are looking, you will at first
  be struck with horror and amazement. But after the horror will come understanding;
  and in the end you will find yourself to be set apart, and honoured above them all."'
