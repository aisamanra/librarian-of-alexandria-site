content: The truth is that we are only potentially homo sapiens. We are set apart
  from the animals precisely by the fact that we are born without any clear guide
  as to how to deal adequately with the problems of our human condition. The great
  marvel and misery of humanity is this capacity for bewilderment. This is not, of
  course, to deny that human being have instincts; it is to affirm the fact that each
  of us is required to find our own non-instinctual answers to the problems of life,
  free and happiness (instinct is silent in the face of all the above questions).
  The sum total of answers we give to the problem of our relationship with the universe,
  we call religion.
