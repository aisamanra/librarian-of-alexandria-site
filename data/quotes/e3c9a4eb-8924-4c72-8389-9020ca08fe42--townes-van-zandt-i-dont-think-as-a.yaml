content: I don't think, as a matter of fact, that I'm going to benefit from anything
  on this earth. It's more like that, I mean, if you have love on the earth, that
  seems to be number one. There's food, water, air and love, right? And love is just
  basically heartbreak. Humans can't live in the present as animals do; they just
  live in the present. But humans are always thinking about the future or the past.
  So, it's a veil of tears, man. And I don't know anything that's going to benefit
  me except more love. I just need an overwhelming amount of love. And a nap. Mostly
  a nap.
