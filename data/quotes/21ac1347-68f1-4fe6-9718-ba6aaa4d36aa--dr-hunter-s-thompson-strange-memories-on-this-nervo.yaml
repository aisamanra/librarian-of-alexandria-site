content: "Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Five years later? \
  \ Six?  It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era \u2014 the kind of peak\
  \ that never comes again.  San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special\
  \ time and place to be a part of.  Maybe it meant something.  Maybe not, in the\
  \ long run... There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the\
  \ Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda...  You could\
  \ strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we\
  \ were doing was right, that we were winning...\n\nAnd that, I think, was the handle\
  \ \u2014 that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in\
  \ any mean or military sense; we didn't need that. Our energy would simply prevail.\
  \  There was no point in fighting \u2014 on our side or theirs.  We had all the\
  \ momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.  So now, less\
  \ than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West,\
  \ and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark \u2014\
  \ that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back."
