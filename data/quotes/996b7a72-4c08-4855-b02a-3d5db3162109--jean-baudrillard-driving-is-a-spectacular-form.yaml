content: 'Driving is a spectacular form of amnesia. Everything is to be discovered,
  everything to be obliterated. Admittedly, there is the primal shock of the deserts
  and the dazzle of California, but when this is gone, the secondary brilliance of
  the journey begins, that of the excessive, pitiless distance, the infinity of anonymous
  faces and distances, or of certain miraculous geological formations, which ultimately
  testify to no human will, while keeping intact an image of upheaval. This form of
  travel admits of no exceptions: when it runs up against a known face, a familiar
  landscape, or some decipherable message, the spell is broken: the amnesic, ascetic,
  asymptotic charm of disappearance succumbs to affect and worldly semiology.'
