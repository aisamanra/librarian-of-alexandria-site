content: Whenever I do things because I want to do it and because it seems fun or
  interesting and so on and so forth, it almost always works. And it almost always
  winds up more than paying for itself. Whenever I do things for the money, not only
  does it prove a headache and a pain in the neck and come with all sorts of awful
  things attached, but I normally don't wind up getting the money, either. So, after
  a while, you do sort of start to learn [to] just forget about the things where people
  come to you and dangle huge wads of cash in front of you. Go for the one that seems
  interesting because, even if it all falls apart, you've got something interesting
  out of it. Whereas, the other way, you normally wind up getting absolutely nothing
  out of it.
