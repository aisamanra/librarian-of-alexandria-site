content: "I still get asked with appalling regularity \"where my ideas come from.\"\
  \r\n\r\nHere's the deal. I flood my poor ageing head with information. Any information.\
  \ Lots of it. And I let it all slosh around in the back of my brain, in the part\
  \ normal people use for remembering bills, thinking about sex and making appointments\
  \ to wash the dishes.\r\n\r\nEventually, you get a critical mass of information.\
  \ Datum 1 plugs into Datum 3 which connects to Datum 3 and Data 4 and 5 stick to\
  \ it and you've got a chain reaction. A bunch of stuff knits together and lights\
  \ up and you've got what's called \"an idea\".\r\n\r\nAnd for that brief moment\
  \ where it's all flaring and welding together, you are Holy. You can't be touched.\
  \ Something impossible and brilliant has happened and suddenly you understand what\
  \ it would be like if Einstein's brain was placed into the body of a young tyrannosaur,\
  \ stuffed full of amphetamines and suffused with Sex Radiation.\r\n\r\nThat is what\
  \ has happened to me tonight. I am beaming Sex Rays across the world and my brain\
  \ is all lit up with Holy Fire. If I felt like it, I could shag a million nuns and\
  \ destroy their faith in Christ.\r\n\r\n*From my chair.*\r\n\r\nSee, this is the\
  \ good bit about writing. It's what keeps you going. It's the wild rush of \"shit,\
  \ did I think of that?\" with all kinds of weird chemicals shunting around your\
  \ brain and ideas and images and moments and storyforms all opening up snapsnapsnap\
  \ in your mind, a mass of new and unrealised possibilities.\r\n\r\nIt's ten past\
  \ two in the morning, and I'm completely wired, caught up in the new thing, shivering\
  \ and laughing and glowing in the dark. Just as well it's the middle of the night.\
  \ No-one would be safe from me right now. I could read their minds and take over\
  \ their heartbeats with a glare.\r\n\r\nFaster than the speed of anyone.\r\n\r\n\
  That's how it works."
