content: "People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life,\
  \ take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings\
  \ and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you're\
  \ not sexy enough and the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making\
  \ your girlfriend feel inedequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology\
  \ the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and\
  \ they are laughing at you.\r\n\r\nYou, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks,\
  \ intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they\
  \ like wherever they like with total impunity.\r\n\r\nFuck that. Any advert in public\
  \ space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It's yours\
  \ to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for\
  \ permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.\r\n\r\
  \nYou owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don't owe them\
  \ any courtsey. They owe you. They have rearranged the world to put themselves in\
  \ front of you. They never asked for your permission, don't even start asking for\
  \ theirs."
