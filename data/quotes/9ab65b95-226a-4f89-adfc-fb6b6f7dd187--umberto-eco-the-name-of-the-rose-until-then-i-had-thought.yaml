author: Umberto Eco, *The Name of The Rose*
content: 'Until then I had thought each book spoke of the things, human or divine,
  that lie outside books. Now I realized that not infrequently books speak of books:
  it is as if they spoke among themselves. In the light of this reflection, the library
  seemed all the more disturbing to me. It was then the place of a long, centuries-old
  murmuring, an imperceptible dialogue between one parchment and another, a living
  thing, a receptacle of powers not to be ruled by a human mind, a treausre of secrets
  emanated by many minds, surviving the death of those who had produced them or had
  been their conveyors.'
