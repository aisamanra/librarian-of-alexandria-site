author: Bertrand Russell
content: Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth, more than ruin, more
  even than death... Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible,
  thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit.
  Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift
  and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man.
