content: Not a single star will be left in the night. The night will not be left.
  I will die and, with me, the weight of the intolerable universe. I shall erase the
  pyramids, the medallions, the continents and faces. I shall erase the accumulated
  past. I shall make dust of history, dust of dust. Now I am looking on the final
  sunset. I am hearing the last bird. I bequeath nothingness to no one.
