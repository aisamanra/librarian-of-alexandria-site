content: The only freedom which counts is the freedom to do what some other people
  think to be wrong. There is no point in demanding freedom to do that which all will
  applaud. All the so-called liberties or rights are things which have to be asserted
  against others who claim that if such things are to be allowed their own rights
  are infringed or their own liberties threatened. This is always true, even when
  we speak of the freedom to worship, of the right of free speech or association,
  or of public assembly. If we are to allow freedoms at all there will constantly
  be complaints that either the liberty itself or the way in which it is exercised
  is being abused, and, if it is a genuine freedom, these complaints will often be
  justified. There is no way of having a free society in which there is not abuse.
  Abuse is the very hallmark of liberty.
