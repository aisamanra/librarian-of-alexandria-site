  yourself to anything they do. the day will come when it is much more important in
  presidential campaigns and to carreers in general that you have not used Microsoft
  than that you have not taken certain drugs. the day will come when we figure out
  which planet Bill Gates was thrown out of and then we can go blow it up. in the
  meantime, resistance is not futile. only the weak of mind will be assimilated, and
  they are no loss, anyway.'
