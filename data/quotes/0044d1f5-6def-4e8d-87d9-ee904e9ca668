content: "Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium\
  \ will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video,\
  \ the crap sound of 8-bit\u2014all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon\
  \ as they can be avoided. It's the sound of failure: so much modern art is the sound\
  \ of things going out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking\
  \ apart. The distorted guitar sound is the sound of something too loud for the medium\
  \ supposed to carry it. The blues singer with the cracked voice is the sound of\
  \ an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that releases it. The excitement\
  \ of grainy film, of bleached-out black and white, is the excitement of witnessing\
  \ events too momentous for the medium assigned to record them."
