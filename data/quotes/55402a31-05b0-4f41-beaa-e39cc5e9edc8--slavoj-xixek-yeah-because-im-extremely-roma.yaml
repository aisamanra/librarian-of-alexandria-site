  \ postmodern, permissive, pragmatic etiquette towards sex. It's horrible. They claim\
  \ sex is healthy; it's good for the heart, for blood circulation, it relaxes you.\
  \ They even go into how kissing is also good because it develops the muscles here\u2014\
  this is horrible, my God! It's no longer that absolute passion. I like this idea\
  \ of sex as part of love, you know: 'I'm ready to sell my mother into slavery just\
  \ to fuck you for ever.' There is something nice, transcendent, about it. I remain\
  \ incurably romantic.\n"
