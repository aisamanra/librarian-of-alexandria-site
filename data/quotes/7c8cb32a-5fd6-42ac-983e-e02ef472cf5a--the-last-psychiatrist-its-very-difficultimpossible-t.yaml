author: The Last Psychiatrist
content: It's very difficult/impossible to raise a kid to be in the system, yet teach
  him also to fight against that system "sometimes." That was one of the problems
  with OWS, you can't shut down Wall Street if you have two credit cards in your back
  pocket. The only way to do this is if you try, on purpose, to raise your kid to
  be a little bit sociopathic. I realize that this seems like strange advice coming
  from a psychiatrist, but I'm not a very good psychiatrist. Also, I drink.
