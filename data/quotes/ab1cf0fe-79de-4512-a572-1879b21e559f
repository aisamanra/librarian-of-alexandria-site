  \ on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride\
  \ goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills and it's very\
  \ brightly coloured and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while. Some people have\
  \ been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question: \"Is this real, or\
  \ is this just a ride?\" And other people have remembered, and they come back to\
  \ us, they say, \"Hey, don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because this is just\
  \ a ride.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we kill those people."
