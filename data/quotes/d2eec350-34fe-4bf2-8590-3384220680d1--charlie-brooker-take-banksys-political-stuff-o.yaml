  \ her clothes napalmed off. Ho-hum, a familiar image, you think. I'll just be on\
  \ my way to my 9 to 5 desk job, mindless drone that I am. Then, with an astonished\
  \ lurch, you notice sly, subversive genius Banksy has stencilled Mickey Mouse and\
  \ Ronald McDonald either side of her.\r\n\r\nWham! The message hits you like a lead\
  \ bus: America... um... war... er... Disney... and stuff. Wow. In an instant, your\
  \ worldview changes forever. Your eyes are opened. Staggering away, mind blown,\
  \ you flick v-signs at a Burger King on the way home. Nice one Banksy!"
