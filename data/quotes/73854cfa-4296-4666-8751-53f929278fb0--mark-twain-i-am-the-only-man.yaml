author: Mark Twain
content: I am the only man living who understands human nature; God has put me in
  charge of this branch office; when I retire there will be no-one to take my place.
  I shall keep on doing my duty, for when I get over on the other side, I shall use
  my influence to have the human race drowned again, and this time drowned good. No
  omissions. No Ark.
