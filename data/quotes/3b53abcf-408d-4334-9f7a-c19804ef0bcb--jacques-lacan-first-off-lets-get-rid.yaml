content: 'First off, let''s get rid of this average Joe, who does not exist. He is
  a statistical fiction. There are individuals, and that is all. When I hear people
  talking about the guy in the street, studies of public opinion, mass phenomena,
  and so on, I think of all the patients that I''ve seen on the couch in forty years
  of listening. None of them in any measure resembled the others, none of them had
  the same phobias and anxieties, the same way of talking, the same fear of not understanding.
  Who is the average Joe: me, you, my concierge, the president of the Republic?'
